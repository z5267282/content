# Overview

I am trying to decide if `~/.zshrc` is the best place to put updates to `$PATH`.  
Right now, putting modifications in `~/.zshrc` is resulting in duplicate folders.

# Order of scripts

There are special scripts prefixed `z` in `/etc` and `~` which control the setup of the shell.  
This is the order in which they are run.

1. `.zshenv`
2. `.zprofile`
3. `.zshrc`
4. `.zlogin`
5. `.zlogout`

There can be up to two copies of these files as per \[1\].

1. The first run is in `/etc`. This is the default configuration.
2. The second one is in `~`. This overwrites the corresponding `/etc` version.

# Solution 1

Source \[1\] recommends putting `$PATH` setup in `.zshenv`.

# Solution 2

Source \[2\] recommends putting them in `zprofile`.  
The issue is that `/etc/zprofile` runs a script `path_helper`.  
This script will **append** changes to `$PATH` made from `~/.zshenv`.  
This is bad because we want our own changes to `$PATH` to be **prepended**.
